# Backend Features

## Overview
The backend is built with FastAPI and serves as the API layer for the application, handling user queries, integrating with the LLM, and returning structured responses. It is designed for security, scalability, and ease of integration with various LLM providers.

## Features

- **User Query Endpoint:**
  - **Purpose:** Receives user questions via POST requests and returns AI-generated answers.
  - **Implementation:** `/query` POST endpoint using FastAPI, accepts JSON payload with a question string. Validates input and returns a structured response.

- **LLM Integration:**
  - **Purpose:** Connects to a selected LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini) using API keys from environment variables.
  - **Implementation:** Uses Python's `requests` or `httpx` library to call the LLM API, with the key loaded from `.env`. Easily extendable to support multiple providers.

- **Response Formatting:**
  - **Purpose:** Structures and formats the LLM's response for frontend consumption.
  - **Implementation:** Parses LLM API response and returns a clean, structured JSON object, including error messages if applicable.

- **Input Validation:**
  - **Purpose:** Ensures user queries are valid and safe.
  - **Implementation:** Uses Pydantic models for request validation, with clear error messages for invalid input.

- **Error Handling:**
  - **Purpose:** Returns meaningful error messages for invalid requests or LLM failures.
  - **Implementation:** FastAPI exception handlers and custom error responses, with logging for debugging.

- **API Documentation:**
  - **Purpose:** Provides auto-generated Swagger docs for all endpoints.
  - **Implementation:** FastAPI's built-in OpenAPI/Swagger UI at `/docs` and `/redoc`.

- **Environment Management:**
  - **Purpose:** Securely manages sensitive configuration like API keys.
  - **Implementation:** Uses `python-dotenv` to load environment variables from `.env` files. `.env.example` provided for easy setup.

- **CORS Support:**
  - **Purpose:** Allows secure cross-origin requests from the frontend.
  - **Implementation:** Configurable CORS middleware for development and production.

- **Logging and Monitoring:**
  - **Purpose:** Tracks API usage and errors for debugging and analytics.
  - **Implementation:** Python logging module, with options for integration with external monitoring tools.

## Extensibility

- Easily add new endpoints for analytics, user management, or additional LLM features.
- Modular codebase for maintainability and scalability.
